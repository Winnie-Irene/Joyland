        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>What we teach</b></h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">As an independent Baptist church, we are not affiliated with any particular Baptist denomination or ruling body. Because of this we can support our own missionaries, select our own leaders, and support institutions that believe as we believe. We get to work with thousands of incredible churches and ministries all across America and the world. In short, our church answers to the headship of Jesus Christ rather than a denominational body.</p>

           <h2 style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: center;">The Bible</h2> 
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: 2;">We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired; that it has truth without any admixture of error for its matter; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of the age, preserved and the only complete and final revelation of the will of God to man. We believe the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament and the Textus Receptus of the New Testament‚Äîby their traditional acceptance and preservation by New Testament churches, to be the inerrant, infallible Word of God. For reasons of unity within the church and textual reliability we choose to use the King James version of the Bible since it is based solely on these texts.

            <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: 2;">We believe in one God, who is eternal, self-existent, infinite, and immutable. We believe He has one nature, one essence, and one substance, yet manifests Himself to man in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All three are equal in every divine perfection, and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of redemption.

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: 2;">We believe Jesus Christ to be the one and only Saviour of mankind. We believe Jesus Christ to be eternally God and to possess all the attributes of Deity. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was virgin born, that He was God incarnate, and that the purposes of the incarnation were to reveal God, to redeem men, and to rule over God's kingdom. We believe Jesus Christ never relinquished any attributes of His Deity, but merely veiled them. We believe He lived a perfect, sinless life, at the end of which He was offered for all mankind as a substitutionary sacrifice for man's sin. This sacrifice was a just payment to God for the forgiveness of sin. It was activated by His death through the shedding of His blood on the Cross and was accepted by God upon His resurrection. We believe He ascended into Heaven after His resurrection to be seated at the right hand of the Father, waiting for the time of receiving all genuine believers at the Rapture, and returning seven years later to earth to rule and reign as King for 1,000 years.

            <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: 2;">We believe all men were born with an inherited sin nature received from our common ancestor, Adam. We believe that because of his nature, man is a sinner by choice, and he is totally incapable of reforming himself or ceasing from his sin by his own power. We believe the only hope of deliverance for man is a total change of mind concerning his sinful condition and inability to change it, and a turning to Jesus Christ as the only Saviour. We believe that only through the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ on the Cross can a man be delivered from his sin. We believe that all those who reject Jesus Christ as their Saviour are already condemned to an eternity in the Lake of Fire.

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: 2;">We believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person; equal with God the Father and God the Son and of the same nature; that He was active in the creation; that in His relation to the unbelieving world He restrains the evil one until God's purpose is fulfilled; that He convicts of sin, of judgment, and of righteousness; that He bears witness to the Truth of the Gospel in preaching and testimony; that He is the agent in the New Birth; that He seals, endues, guides, teaches, witnesses, sanctifies, and helps the believer.

        <h1>What‚Äôs in the name Baptist?</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">This church is a Baptist church by conviction and principle, not by affiliation. This means that we believe the basic Bible teachings for which Baptists have historically stood. As Baptists, we believe the following: the Bible is our sole authority for all matters of faith and practice. The church should be autonomous or self-governing. The believer does not need a priest, other than Jesus Christ, to come boldly to God. Every Christian has equal access to God personally. God's Word gives us two ordinances for the church: baptism and the Lord's supper. Each person is individually responsible for his decision to accept Christ. The believer is eternally secure and cannot lose salvation. There are two biblical offices in the church: pastors and deacons. As Christians, we are to live holy for the Lord in every aspect of our life.</p>
